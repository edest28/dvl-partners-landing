                <h2>On the Moment</h2>
                <p>
                    We are at an inflection point. AI, automation, and data infrastructure are no longer concepts
                    reserved for large enterprises - they are practical tools reshaping how service businesses operate
                    today. The firms that will define the next decade are the ones leaning in now, asking how technology
                    can remove friction and create capacity across their operations.

                <h2>On People First</h2>
                <p>
                    Our belief is simple: technology should elevate people, not replace them. The best service
                    businesses are built on trust and human judgment, and no algorithm changes that. What technology can
                    do is free your team from the manual processes and operational noise that get in the way of their
                    best work - so they can spend more time on the moments that actually matter to your customers.

                <h2>On Building What's Needed</h2>
                <p>
                    The businesses of tomorrow will be defined by how thoughtfully they use technology to improve
                    service delivery and customer experience. Sometimes that means adopting the right platforms.
                    Sometimes it means building proprietary technology tailored to your business. DVL is equipped to do
                    both - with operators and technologists working side by side, we don't just identify the right
                    solution, we build and implement it with you.

                <h2>On How We Partner</h2>
                <p>
                    We partner with founders and owners who are thinking about what comes next. Whether you are looking
                    for a full exit, partial liquidity, or something in between, we are flexible and committed to
                    finding a structure that works on your terms. Every founder's situation is different - and we think
                    the best partnerships reflect that.
